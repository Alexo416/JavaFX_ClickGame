# JavaFX_ClickGame ðŸ–±

This is a click game I created while learning Java and JavaFX in school. In this game you are presented with an enemy in the middle with massive HP and as you continue to click the gold amount increases allowing you to purchase one of two items +20 Damage (100 Gold) or +2 damage (50 Gold). The user will continue to click until the enemy is dead.
